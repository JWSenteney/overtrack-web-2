                <p>
                    Using Computer Vision, OverTrack records and processes a screenshot every second.
                    By extracting relevant information from each screenshot, it can keep track of your Apex games for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To track your games, download and install the OverTrack Client.
                </p>
                <a href="/client" class="btn btn-success">Client Download</a>

                <h3 style="padding-top: 20pt">Games History</h3>
                <p>
                    OverTrack will record a list of each of your games including placement, downs, kills, etc.
                </p>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/games_list.jpg') }}">

                <h3 style="padding-top: 20pt">Full Game Details</h3>
                <p>
                    Each game recorded contains the route taken including all recorded downs and eliminations.
                    Weapon stats and assists are also recorded and provided.
                    Endgame statistics are also recorded and displayed (provided you didn't skip those screens).
